## Summary:
The drawback of this webpage  the image is huge for phone users and when you open the webpage  on the phone it zooms out and resizing is a major problem that can be fixed by formatting the readjust 
Another drawback the input of the filter is difficult to delete  if there were a button for deleting will make the webpage easier to use  
An additional drawback of creating so many filters  it  makes searching more complex  if it has only two up to three filters will be better to use 
additional recommendations for further development
The first one will be reducing the number of filters to make it easier to use
Resizing the table to make it  more visible  so you can check the data before searching 
Adding delete (button) to the filters
